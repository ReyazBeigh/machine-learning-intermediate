# Machine Learning Intermediate Course

- Demonstrate how we can handle better the missing values from the data. There might be multiple causes of missing values in the data source. 3 approaches to work around the missing values are: 
`1 - Dropping the column that has missing value(s)`
`2 - Imputing the missing values`
`3 - Imputing the missing values and keeping track of the missing values`
`Choice 2 has been proved to be best`
